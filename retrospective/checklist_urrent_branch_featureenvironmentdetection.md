## 🛠 Setup and Configuration
- [ ] Install required packages:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- [ ] Create .env file in project root:
  ```
  ENVIRONMENT=development
  ```
- [ ] Update config.py for environment detection
- [ ] Implement environment detection in `bigquery_setup/auth/environment.py`
- [ ] Create environment-specific JSON files in config/ directory

## 🧪 Testing
- [ ] Implement unit tests for environment detection
- [ ] Run tests:
  ```bash
  pytest
  ```
- [ ] Ensure all tests pass
- [ ] Achieve desired code coverage (e.g., >80%)

## 📚 Documentation
- [ ] Update README.md with project overview
- [ ] Add usage instructions to README.md
- [ ] Document environment setup process
- [ ] Add inline comments to key functions

## 🔄 Version Control
- [ ] Ensure .gitignore includes:
  - [ ] .env
  - [ ] *.pyc
  - [ ] __pycache__/
- [ ] Commit all new and modified files
- [ ] Create pull request for feature/environment_detection

## 🚀 Next Steps and Improvements
- [ ] Implement error handling for missing configuration files
- [ ] Add logging functionality
- [ ] Create user guide for setting up different environments
- [ ] Implement continuous integration (CI) pipeline
- [ ] Add type hints to functions
- [ ] Optimize performance of environment detection
- [ ] Consider adding support for custom environment names

## 🐛 Bug Fixes and Refinements
- [ ] Address any failing tests
- [ ] Refactor code for better readability
- [ ] Ensure consistent code style across all files
- [ ] Validate input in configuration files

## 🔍 Code Review
- [ ] Perform self-review of all changes
- [ ] Request peer review of pull request
- [ ] Address reviewer comments and suggestions

## 🚀 Deployment
- [ ] Update version number in setup.py
- [ ] Create release notes
- [ ] Tag release in git
- [ ] Publish package to PyPI (if applicable)

## 📊 Metrics and Monitoring
- [ ] Implement performance metrics for environment detection
- [ ] Set up monitoring for configuration file changes
- [ ] Track usage of different environments

Remember to update this checklist as you progress through the development process. Mark items as completed using [x] instead of [ ]. Add new items or sections as needed to reflect the evolving requirements of your project.
