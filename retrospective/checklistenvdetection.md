Certainly! I'll provide an updated checklist with checkmarks for all resources, files, and directories, and combine the git commands into a single code block that outputs to a file. Here's the revised checklist and the command block:

```markdown
# Environment Detection Feature Checklist

## 🌿 Feature Branch
- [ ] Create and checkout feature branch:
  ```bash
  git checkout -b feature/environment-detection
  ```

## 📁 Directory Structure
- [x] bigquery_setup/
  - [x] bigquery_setup/
    - [x] auth/
      - [x] environment.py
- [x] config/
  - [x] development.json
  - [x] staging.json
  - [x] production.json
- [x] dev_tools/
- [x] examples/
- [x] tests/
  - [x] bigquery_setup/
    - [x] auth/
      - [x] environment_test.py
- [x] utils/
- [ ] .env
- [x] config.py

## 🛠 Setup and Installation
- [ ] Install python-dotenv:
  ```bash
  pip install python-dotenv
  ```
- [ ] Add python-dotenv to requirements.txt:
  ```bash
  echo "python-dotenv" >> requirements.txt
  ```

## 📄 File Creation and Configuration
- [ ] Create .env file in project root
- [ ] Update config.py in project root
- [ ] Update environment-specific JSON files in config/ directory:
  - [x] config/development.json
  - [x] config/staging.json
  - [x] config/production.json

## 🧪 Testing
- [ ] Create/update tests for environment detection
- [ ] Run tests and verify correct configuration loading for each environment

## 📚 Documentation
- [ ] Update project README.md with environment setup instructions
- [ ] Document environment switching process
- [ ] Add comments to config.py explaining the environment detection logic

## 🔄 Version Control
- [ ] Add .env to .gitignore
- [ ] Commit all new and updated files

## 🚀 Next Steps
- [ ] Implement unit tests for environment detection logic
- [ ] Consider implementing a fallback mechanism for missing configuration files
- [ ] Evaluate the need for encryption of sensitive configuration data
```

Now, here's the combined git command block that will output the workflow review to a file:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Output file
output_file="git_workflow_review.txt"

# Clear the file if it exists
> "$output_file"

# Function to add a section header
add_section() {
    echo -e "\n=== $1 ===" >> "$output_file"
}

# Recent commits
add_section "Recent Commits"
git log --oneline --graph --decorate -n 10 >> "$output_file"

# Files changed in recent commits
add_section "Files Changed in Recent Commits"
git log --name-status -n 5 >> "$output_file"

# All branches
add_section "All Branches"
git branch -vv >> "$output_file"

# Current branch status
add_section "Current Branch Status"
git status -b >> "$output_file"

# Commit history compared to develop
add_section "Commit History Compared to Develop"
git log develop..HEAD --oneline >> "$output_file"

# Files changed compared to develop
add_section "Files Changed Compared to Develop"
git diff --stat develop >> "$output_file"

echo "Git workflow review has been saved to $output_file"
```

You can save this script as `generate_git_review.sh` in your project root, make it executable with `chmod +x generate_git_review.sh`, and then run it with `./generate_git_review.sh`. This will create a `git_workflow_review.txt` file in your project root with all the relevant git information.

This approach allows you to:
1. Track progress on the checklist by marking items as complete.
2. Generate a comprehensive git workflow review.
3. Easily share both the checklist state and git information in future sessions.

You can then use this information to analyze your workflow, identify any missing steps, and make improvements to your development process.
